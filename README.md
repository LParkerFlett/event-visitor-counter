Scrimba tutorial: Practical use of basic JavaScript to create an event visitor counter.

Use an onclick event handler HTML attribute to call and run functions like increment() and save() when their corresponding buttons get clicked.

This is an intuitive, straightforward way to understand how event listeners can be attached to HTML elements and grasp the basics of interactivity.

This is not recommended for larger real world projects since mixing HTML structure and JavaScript behavior like this can lead to code that is harder to maintain and manage.
